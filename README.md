# Detecting Alzheimer’s Severity using Convolution Neural Networks

This project will explore how different characteristics of brain scans are used to detect the severity of Alzheimer's in individuals.

## Contents
This repository contains instructions on obtaining and cleaning the data used, code that completes and creates time series visualizations, and licensing and reference information.

# Software and Platform

This projected was completed using the python programming language. For Python, we used VS Code and Google Colab. The platform used was Mac. If using VS Code to reproduce results, a Python kernel will need to be used in order to use Python and import the packages used in the scripts.
